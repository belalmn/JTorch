# JTorch - CPSC 210 Personal Project
## Description
### What will the application do?

The intention for this project is to implement a small **Deep Learning** framework, and apply it towards a specific task, such as recognizing handwritten digits and matching them to the right value. This project will allow users to adjust some training hyperparameters, visualize the training progress, and test the trained model by providing their own inputted images/values. The project is aptly named JTorch, to combine the idea of **J**ava and Py**Torch**, the well-known but python-based deep learning framework.

### Who will use this application?

The scope of this project is limited and likely won't embrace the many aspects of high-class frameworks like PyTorch, such as GPU acceleration or optimizations for massive datasets. With this in mind, the audience for this application are **students who want to tinker with Neural Networks in a graphical manner**. Being able to alter different training parameters, visualize the learning process of a Neural Network, and testing it directly, are all things that would be educational and valuable to students who want to learn more about Deep Learning.

### Why is this project of interest to me?

I am an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer and Research Scientist, with growing experience in building models that shape how machines interpret language, vision, and data all around us. I'm passionate about teaching difficult concepts in Deep Learning to people around me, and through this application, I myself gain a refresher on Deep Learning under the hood, and the opportunity to showcase this in an educational manner to students and colleagues alike.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to create tensors and perform basic operations like addition and multiplication to prepare data for my neural network.

- As a user, I want to add layers (like Dense or Activation layers) to my neural network model so I can customize its architecture.

- As a user, I want to train the neural network on a dataset to develop a model that can make accurate predictions.

- As a user, I want to monitor training metrics such as loss and accuracy to evaluate the model's performance over time.

- As a user, I want to choose the optimization algorithm (e.g., SGD) for training my neural network to improve learning efficiency.

- As a user, I want to view the neural networkâ€™s architecture, including the layers and their connections, to understand the structure of my model.
